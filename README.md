# Bibliometrics

📄 Methodology
1. Data Source and Search Strategy
The bibliometric data for this analysis was retrieved from the [Scopus/PubMed/Web of Science] database (Note: choose your database). The search strategy was designed to capture the entire landscape of cytoneme research, including early nomenclature and functional synonyms.

The following Boolean search string was applied to the "Title/Abstract/Keywords" fields:

Plaintext

("cytoneme*" OR "signaling filopodia" OR "signaling protrusions" OR "specialized filopodia")
AND
("signaling" OR "morphogen" OR "transport" OR "communication")
2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Time Period: From inception (1999) to [Current Year].

Document Types: Original Research Articles and Reviews were included. Editorials, errata, and conference abstracts were excluded to ensure data quality.

Language: Limited to English-language publications.

3. Data Normalization (Thesaurus)
To ensure accurate clustering and keyword frequency analysis, raw keywords extracted from the dataset were normalized using a controlled vocabulary (Thesaurus). This step corrects for spelling variations (e.g., Drosophila vs. Drosophila melanogaster) and groups functional synonyms.

The semantic mapping used for this analysis is detailed below.

🧱 Thesaurus & Keyword Mapping
The following dictionary was applied to merge synonymous terms and categorize biological concepts during the text mining phase.
